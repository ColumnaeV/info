                <h3>Hello There!</h3>
                <p>My name is Christian Nguyen and I like digital art. All of my work so far has been free of charge (which I plan it to always be) so you don't need to worry about monetary compensation. My main focus was website development, but I've also picked up some Photoshop skills and developed my own style of editing. Most of the edits I do usually compose of Double Exposure, Brush, Linear Gradient, and White Outline effects.</p>
                <p>So, if you are interested in my website development projects, I would suggest visiting my main page. There you would find a lot more information about me and the projects in which I have developed for other people of the community.</p>
                <center>
                    <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://clsnguyen.com/" target="_blank"><div class="btn">Visit Main Page</div></a>
                </center>
                <p>Mayhaps my current projects haven't given you that spark of interest and you're wanting to develop the project yourself. No hard feelings, but I can also consult on design methods and frontend code efficiency / techniques. Just draw me up a design plan and I'll give you my personal and professional opinion.</p>

                <p>Website development isn't for everyone, but maybe you like photo edits. If the background of the cover above of my mate Shubhayu interests you, send me a photo and I can do an edit. Don't be afraid if none of my artwork currently demonstrates a editing style in which you desire. I'm always eager to learn a new editing style! If you are interested in a photo edit, you can email me it and a message of what exactly you would like to see in it.</p>

                </center>
                <p>Perhaps you'd like to try the editing yourself but aren't sure where to start. Well that's alright. We could try to work it together and see what you create, but if it's gone pear-shaped we can get assistance from the C&amp;C Studios Photography and/or Graphic Design/Editing teams.</p>

                <p>Or possibly, in the rarest occasion (which is why I've placed this at the very bottom), you're actually interested in the artist himself and would like to get to know him, I'm sure he's more than welcome to have a conversation over boba. His contact information can be found at the footer of his main page.</p>
                <p>Cheers,</p>
